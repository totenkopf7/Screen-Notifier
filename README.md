# Screen Notifier
Screen Notifier is a practical GUI application tailored for programmers and individuals who spend long hours on their computers. It actively promotes healthy screen habits by forcing you to take breaks. Once activated, it temporarily freezes your mouse, keyboard, and monitor, ensuring you step away from the screen for a while.

Note: This application is designed to work only with single-monitor setups. It does not support or function on systems with dual monitors or more.

# Usage
 All you got to do is set a timer and a task to be reminded of and that's it. Its GUI is friendly and easy to use.
